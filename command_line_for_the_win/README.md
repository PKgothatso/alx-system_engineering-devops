##Steps for png files transfer using SFTP##:

This project required the use of the SFTP (Secure File Transfer Protocol) command-line tool to transfer screenshots from a local machine to a sandbox environment. Here are the steps I followed:

1. *Take Screenshots*:
 I took screenshots of the completed levels as required by the project guidelines.

2. *Open Terminal*:
I opened a terminal on my local machine.

3. *Establish SFTP Connection*:
I used the SFTP command-line tool to establish a connection to the sandbox environment. The necessary hostname, username, and password were provided.

    sftp> username@hostname
    sftp > password: ************

4. *Navigate to Directory*:
Once connected, I navigated to the directory where I wanted to upload the screenshots.

   sftp> cd /root/alx-system_engineering-devops/command_line_for_the_win/

5. **Upload Screenshots**:
I used the SFTP 'put' with the '-p' flag command to upload the screenshots from my local machine to the sandbox environment.

  sftp> put -p "C:\\Users\\Accountname\\Pictures\\Screenshots\\0-first_9_tasks.png"
  sftp> put -p "C:\\Users\\Accountname\\Pictures\\Screenshots\\1-next_9_tasks.png"
  sftp> put -p "C:\\Users\\Accountname\\Pictures\\Screenshots\\2-next_9_tasks.png"

6. **Confirm Transfer**:
I confirmed that the screenshots had been successfully transferred by checking the sandbox directory.
   
  sftp> ls

7. **Exit SFTP**:
Lastly, I exited the SFTP connection.

  sftp> exit

This process ensured that the screenshots were successfully transferred to the sandbox environment before being pushed to GitHub.
